					Introduction to games
					</div>
				My love for gaming started before I can remember, and probably as soon as I was able to play. 
				My introduction began on the SNES playing Street fighter II, moving to the PS2 and Battlefont II when I was older. <br>
				I can still remember being caught playing BFII before school by my dad, 
				who from that point knew he should probably make sure I do things other than play video games

					About me
					</div>
				In school, I mainly took an interest in Psychology, Politics and Spanish (my 3 A-Level subjects)
				however I still enjoyed what other subjects had to offer such as creative writing in English. <br>
				Outside of education, I like to go skateboarding, make music and of course play video games.
				Im very excited to find out how I will incorporate different aspects of my life into my work 
				within game design
				</div>
				<div class="boxThree" style="float:left"> Later in life I hope to be in a job in which I will find an everyday satisfaction, 
				this could be within game design, music or any of the other creative outlets we have avaliable to us.
				
				As of writing this, I am yet to experience all the facets game design has to offer and I am excited to begin the different modules.
				For example, I am quite exited to immerse myself in level design, narrative writing, models and animation.<br>

				<div class="boxThreeP2">
				I hope to find myself working a placement year
				at a company in which I can say I was excited to be part of their game development.

					In the summer of 2020 I began making music with two of my friends in  my garage at home,
